# Global Food Price Changes


## Comparing food cost prices overtime internationally
* Our goal is to look at food prices over a ten-year span and determine which factors could cause Fluctuations in price
This project is an example on how to take raw data, clean it, and visualize it into easy to understand charts by doing the following:
* Download original data via www.kaggle.com as csv files
* Clean data using Python
* Put data into data frames using Pandas
* Import cleaned data from python to SQL data base using Pgadmin
* Use flask api with JavaScript to create visualizations
